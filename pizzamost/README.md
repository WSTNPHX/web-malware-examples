# Pizzamost FTP Brute Forcer

-- An encoded, dictionary-word-named PHP file (binoculars.php) is uploaded and executes redundant wget and curl commands to download and run a Bash script.

-- The Bash script (hun) checks for an existing malicious process (./cfg) and if it’s not present, cleans house and downloads a tarball (y.tgz) that writes a hidden directory (.lvl) and starts the malicious process it just checked for.

-- .lvl/cfg is an infinite loop which downloads 400 text files of 129,020 domains each named ft<1-400> and then runs the next script, ./esc ft* $rand2, where $rand2 is a range from 1 to 243. It then removes the ft<1-400> files.

-- esc searches for 2,000 processes named httpd and if there are less than 2,000, start a new process named tty, passing a domain name from an ft<1-400> file and random number.

-- tty consists of 243 functions named x<1-243>. Each function takes the provided domain name and converts it for username and password use by removing dots and dashes and appending “123” to the domain for the password. tty then calls nd.pl passing the domain, username, and password as arguments.

-- nd.pl is FTP Brute Forcer by ali, and it performs a horizontal brute force attack on the provided domains, logging successful results with a GET request to an attacker-controlled web server. The brute forcer process masquerades as a web server using the process name “httpd.”
